Understanding Decision Trees: From Basics to Hyperparameter Tuning

Today, let’s dive into Decision Trees, covering key concepts like pruning methods, hyperparameter tuning, handling data imbalance, and more.

What is a Decision Tree?

A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both regression and classification tasks. It works by splitting data into branches based on feature values, ultimately leading to a prediction.

The three main components of a decision tree are:
	1.	Root Node – The starting point of the tree.
	2.	Decision Nodes – Nodes where the data splits based on features.
	3.	Leaf Nodes – The final output or decision points.

How Does a Decision Tree Select the Root Node?

To determine the best root node, the algorithm uses either Gini Impurity or Information Gain. These metrics help identify the most significant feature for splitting the data.

Project: Predicting Wine Quality Using Decision Trees

In my dataset, we have 1,143 rows and 11 features. The target variable (wine quality) has multiple categories, making logistic regression unsuitable. Instead, a decision tree is a better choice for multi-class classification.

Data Preprocessing Steps:
	1.	Handling Missing Values:
	•	If a column’s distribution is symmetric, I apply mean imputation.
	•	If it’s skewed, I use median imputation.
	2.	Outlier Detection & Removal:
	•	By plotting outliers, I found multiple extreme values.
	•	After removing them, the dataset reduced by 28%, leaving us with 848 rows.
	3.	Feature Scaling:
	•	I standardized the data, scaling values between -1 to +1.
	•	Important Note: Never standardize the target column, as it alters its meaning.

Model Training & Evaluation

After training the DecisionTreeClassifier, I checked the R² score, which was -0.42—indicating poor performance.

Fixing Model Performance: Hyperparameter Tuning

To improve accuracy, I applied hyperparameter tuning, which helps reduce overfitting or underfitting. There are two common approaches:
	1.	GridSearchCV – Exhaustively searches all parameter combinations (accurate but slow).
	2.	RandomizedSearchCV – Randomly selects parameter combinations (faster but less precise).

I used GridSearchCV, but it took 30-35 minutes per run, requiring multiple iterations to find optimal values.

Challenges & Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was improving the R² score from -0.42 to a positive value. After extensive outlier handling, data imputation, and hyperparameter tuning, I achieved an R² score of 0.36. While this is still not great, transforming a negative score to a positive one was a rewarding challenge!
